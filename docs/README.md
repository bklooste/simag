# Introduction

## What is SimAG?

SimAG, or simply, `simag`, is an experimental high-level modular artificial intelligence framework built on an agent-based architecture meant for production and research alike.

The idea behind simag is to combine several techniques and methodologies to produce agents that can
interact in different environments, making them hopefully useful for things as dispare as 
real environment simulations, big data and pattern recognition and videogame development
amongst others.

The modularity of the design allows for the consumer of the framework/library to pick
only what they are interested on, or implement the whole architecture.

Simag builds on proved different techniques, as well as introduces its own concepts, to build powerful, expressive and performant inference, planning, learning and pattern recognition engines which can be joint or disjoint and tunned at different levels to achieve powerful autonomous agents which can interact with other agents and the environment. It leverages amongst other
techniques neural networks and pattern recognition, logic programming and inference or dynamic bayesian networks. Simag itself is powered by other mature
open source libraries where necessary (like ...).

Simag is an on-goign development effort and in an ever changing state of change (hence "experimental"), however it will hopefully offer an stable API at certain milestones.
